## Type-along automating `pytest`

We are now going to continue working on the test examples using `pytest`
introduced by Per. This time we will use the power of github actions to
automatically run the tests for us. 

!!! note
    This code-along is heavily based by the fantastic CodeRefinery workshop and
    their introduction to automated testing:
    <https://coderefinery.github.io/testing/continuous-integration/#type-along-exercise-continuous-integration>.
    They also include examples for testing in other languages like `Fortran,
    Julia, R` and `C++`.



!!! tip "What we will be doing"
    - A: Create a repository on GitHub
    - B: Commit Per's test example (The tests will not pass at this point)
    - C: Open an issue and report the bug
    - D: Create a new branch to fix the bug and open a pull request
    - E: Merge the pull request

Step 1: Create a new repository on GitHub
