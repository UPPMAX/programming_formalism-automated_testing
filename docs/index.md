# Overview

This short module is intended to introduce how testing can be automated using
Github(GH) Actions. We will also look into other common usages of GH Actions
like formatting, linting and type checking. 

## Learning Outcomes

* Understand the value of continuous development (CI)
* Practical experience about how Github actions can be used to automate
  testing
* Understand how code quality can be improved by automating type checking,
  linting and code formatting
